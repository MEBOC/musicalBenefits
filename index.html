	<!-- M8LO7 Demonstrate the use of the <audio> element for embedding audio in a Web page (HTML) 
	In this section I've put sample audios from each of the 4 major groups of instruments in case anyone wants to sample/learn what they sound like.
	Percussion is not included for obvious reasons. This adds legitimacy to the premise of the site by giving visitors a chance to sample or a reminder of what these instruments sound like.-->

	Putting this video in demostrates many of the potential amazing elements and benefits of musical proficiency just from being able to view and hear a symphonic orchestra performance.
	This adds credibility to the website as a recruiting tool by visually showing visitors what one of the pinnacles of learning this craft is. Using the iframe element helps signify that this is
