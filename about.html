		<p>I followed the assignment instructions as best I possibly could.  
		For my own sense-making I incorporated some of the sub-page ideas I had highlighted in my original 
		project proposal as it makes the page look better and felt to me like it was much easier to actually 
		complete the assignment if I had more webpages/code to work with. I haven't really fleshed out the 
		sub-pages yet.

		<h1>I did this for extra cash money, which I create and make for myself but mostly through educational tools provided by OC (Hunnids)</h1>

		<p>I played around with a lot of the new functions, and ended up generating more fake text about instruments and musicianship so I would have more
		material on the website for me to modify.  Regardless of how that's taken, I figure I'm here to learn about modifying web pages and I didn't have 
		any grand website idea that I have time to fully flesh out with information.

		<p>I had difficulties with the flex properties and modifying my content (or creating some accordingly) and ended up doing something simple with it.
		I had a lot of fun creating a table which readily fixed issues with creating the column/row grid layout I'd had in V2, which was my biggest change. I also added a pulldown menu 
		for the start of the page which links to other areas of the page which have more complete descriptions. I mostly worked
		from the instruments page for this version as it had been my most lacking one, with plans to use the tools in later units to work my my skills page for V4.  I added a media.css page for
		the addition of screen editing but it's only linked to one of my pages because it was difficult to get things set up where it functioned with every page
		without scrapping large portions and starting from scratch.
